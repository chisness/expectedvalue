probabilistic process that generates value, ev is average of all possible outcomes, each possible outcome weighted by its probability of occurring. 

We know what an average of set of n values is, it's sum of values divided by n. e.g. 3 die rolls. like weighted sum of the values. weights add up to 1. 

E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]
E[a*X] = a*E[X]
EV of 3 die rolls is sum 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 

can do for die roll
