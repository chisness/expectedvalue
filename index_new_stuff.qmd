We know what an average of set of n values is, it's sum of values divided by n. e.g. 3 die rolls. like weighted sum of the values. weights add up to 1. 

probabilistic process that generates value, ev is average of all possible outcomes, each possible outcome weighted by its probability of occurring. 

EV = E[X] = sum(i) prob(x=x_i)*x_i
weights sum to 1

can do for die roll
EV is not a possible outcome, but summarizes set of possible outcomes 

E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]
E[a*X] = a*E[X]
EV of 3 die rolls is sum 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5
