Bet Sizing
Think About What You’re Targeting with Your Bet Size
Every bet you make targets some part of your opponent’s range. By “target”, we mean those hands are indifferent between calling and folding facing your bet.
The hands you target determine your value bet thresholds. Consider how to get value and what sizing makes sense to target those parts of their range.
So how do we know what hands we’re targeting? Well, you need to look at villain’s response to a bet.

It’s important to look at villain’s strategy to see how they respond. Then, ask yourself if their response is realistic and what adjustments you might make against different mistakes.
Looking at their response helps you to understand why the solution works in the first place, understand blockers, and think through your strategy.
