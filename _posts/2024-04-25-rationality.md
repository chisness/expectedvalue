Instrumental Rationality: the skills you need to achieve your goals. What do you value for its own sake? What are the things you want to achieve above all else, the things your other actions are stepping-stones towards? These terminal goals could be happiness, improving the world, becoming famous, anything. Now ask yourself what you did this past hour. Was it the best possible action you could have taken to achieve your goals? We help you achieve your goals by giving you tools that help you become accustomed to making plans and habits that actually work and inch you in the direction you want to go.

Epistemic rationality: the use of evidence and reason to form accurate beliefs about the world. Specific skills we will teach include Bayesian reasoning, statistics, epistemology, cognitive biases, forecasting, and building models of complex systems. We teach epistemic rationality by offering interesting and complex ideas for you to discuss, debate, and form beliefs about. We also equip you with useful ideas that help you think clearly about uncertainty and complex systems.


From https://rationalpoker.com/2011/07/30/23-cognitive-mistakes-that-make-people-play-bad-poker/ 
Ignoring evidence
Inattention is the tendency to fail to concentrate on information that could be useful for future decision making.
Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions.
Focusing effect is the tendency to place too much importance on one aspect of an event; causes error in accurately predicting the utility of a future outcome.
Availability heuristic is estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, unusual, or emotionally charged examples.
Not knowing the math (Innumeracy)
Neglect of probability is the tendency to completely disregard probability when making a decision under uncertainty.
Base rate neglect is the tendency to base judgments on specifics, ignoring general statistical information.
Attitude problems
Loss aversion is people’s tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains.
Self-serving bias is  the tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests.
Overconfidence is the state of being more certain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence available. For example, for certain types of questions, answers that people rate as “99% certain” turn out to be wrong 40% of the time.
Negativity Bias is paying more attention to and giving more weight to negative rather than positive or neutral experiences.
Optimism bias is the tendency to be over-optimistic about the outcome of planned actions.
Superstition
Clustering illusion (Apophenia) is the tendency to see patterns where none exist.
Illusion of control is the tendency to overestimate one’s degree of influence over external events.
Gambler’s fallacy is the tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged.
Just-world phenomenon is the tendency for people to believe that the world is just and therefore people “get what they deserve.”
Frustration
Irrational escalation is the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the decision was probably wrong.
Pessimism bias is the tendency for some people, especially those suffering from depression, to overestimate the likelihood of negative things happening to them.
Projection bias is the tendency to unconsciously assume that others (or one’s future selves) share one’s current emotional states, thoughts and values.
Mis-remembering reality
Outcome bias is the tendency to judge a decision by its eventual outcome instead of based on the quality of the decision at the time it was made.
Hindsight bias is sometimes called the “I-knew-it-all-along” effect, the tendency to see past events as being predictable at the time those events happened.
Consistency bias is remembering one’s past attitudes and behavior as more similar to one’s present attitudes.
Primacy effect is the tendency to weigh initial events more than subsequent events.
Peak-end rule is how we judge our past experiences almost entirely on how they were at their peak (pleasant or unpleasant) and how they ended.
Cognitive Biases https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what_exactly_ishtml 
Gambler’s Fallacy
https://old-wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Category:Biases 
Overconfidence
Overrate own judgment and performance
Learn to find this behavior and spot it and correct it, good training ground for biases like this
Poker very sure opponent has something or that you’re better than table, gets better as you become better player
Being good means you just notice others are kind of bad (something like that) 
Outcome bias - results based
Scope insensitivity - chips matter not pots
self-serving bias
the tendency to attribute success to internal or personal factors but attribute failure to situational factors beyond our control.
Making excuses, blaming others/external factors
Shouldn’t be ashamed to be biased, should learn from it
Think about how your body feels and what goes through your mind to help realize next time
The ‘JimmyLegs Theorem’ states:
Given that the Self-Serving Bias will cause you to take credit for your successes but blame luck for your failures, you should ALWAYS assume that you made mistakes in the hand, regardless of whether or not you actually won the pot, at least until it can be categorically proven otherwise.
Hindsight Bias (ex ante, ex post)
Overestimate obviousness of events after they’ve occurred (e.g. I knew it!) 
Tries to limit emotional loss in moment of pain/embarrassment
E.g. ever claim would have known something only after knowing outcome, but wuldn’t’ have bet on it before? 
Motivated Reasoning
Sunk Cost Fallacy - protect investment, chip is not yours as soon as it is put into the pot
Frequency Illusion
Should be looking for failure mode (i.e. mistakes), otherwise keep repeating. Poker good at amplifying this due to lots of decisions. 


Copy this part separate as “readthestraights” a la Eliezer?
Cost of irrationality:https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ujTE9FLWveYz9WTxZ/what-cost-for-irrationality 
I think a good addition to the rationality section would be to "steel man" instead of "straw man" positions you disagree with.
Zvi: 
It is important to note, however, that this is not the only thing poker players value. Most players to some extent value fun, however they see fun. There are those who primarily want to take risk, or pass the time, or hang out with their friends. Often one will be itching for some action, and participate far more than they themselves know they should. Many will value information about what is in your hand, or are seeking to gain experience. A few are experimenting to see what happens. A small number will even be seeking to improve their rationality. A great number will value pride. Some will seek to destroy certain opponents and help others. If you model your opponents as always seeking only to win you will end up with a poor model of their behavior, and that’s before all the biases they have!
There are also poker tournaments, in which the play continues until one person has all the chips and what matters is the order in which players lose all their chips rather than the number of chips you leave with after the game. This determines who finishes in what position, which in turn determines the prizes. Sometimes being the one left with all the chips and thereby winning is most important, sometimes it is not. Here opponents will have even more unique goals. Some will seek volatility, while others will seek survival. Some will want to make sure they win at least some prize while others will only care about winning outright.
There is nothing wrong with sharing many of these motivations, but in a serious game never forget to focus only on what matters: The expected value of your play in terms of chips and dollars.
Rationality
Start at science and god not real then realize have to 
Hack Brain to be rational, built for survival etc 
Brains from natural selection, if you want to see truth, have to figure out how to use brain 
Knowing the math isn’t useful if you are biased and use bad judgment in conjunction with the odds and math
Betting way to show rationality 
Probability range
Rationalism: The art of figuring out what is happening, thinking logically, how to model world. Then make decisions on that basis. 
Thinking.l clearly. Think about how things really work and engage. 
Systematic modeling and decisions, decision theory and Bayes
Intuitive vs rational, notice vibes and update associates vibes I tuitions in that direction and works pretty well. Trying to be rational yields confusion since have to be more curious or say current systems not working. Poker could be basic thinking like winning or losing call or fold rather than full analysis. Rationality in dating? Correlation vs causation. Still have to include intuitions! Combine rationality with intuition! Stop to think about consequences and expected value
Could call this The Straights after The Sequences
Combine rational EV stuff and vibes/intuition 
Most people trial and error 
If not good enough don’t have oops to get better so they try rational approach
