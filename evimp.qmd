Expected value is fundamental in decision-making under uncertainty, a key area of focus for effective altruists. It allows individuals to make choices that maximize their positive impact, even when outcomes are uncertain. This principle is frequently discussed on platforms like the Effective Altruism Forum and in related literature.

While I can't pinpoint the exact source of the most upvoted answer you mentioned, it's consistent with the general emphasis within the community on understanding and applying expected value to make better decisions.
