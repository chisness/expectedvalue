Why? The probability of an event and its complement always sum to \\(1\\). For example, if it’s \\(70\\%\\) to be sunny tomorrow, then it’s \\(30\\%\\) to be not-sunny.\nMathematically, we can write:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\Pr(\\text{Preg after 6 attempts}) &= 1 - \\Pr(\\text{Not Preg after 6 attempts}) \\\\\n  &= 1 - (0.8)^6 \\\\\n  &= 0.738 \\\\\n  &= 73.8\\%\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\nIndependent Probabilities\nWhy is it \\(1 - (0.8)^6\\)? This is because when we are calculating probabilities involving independent events, they are multiplied. Each case of not becoming pregnant has an independent probability of \\(0.8\\) (note that this is a simplification because probabilities would generally vary for each attempt). Multiplying this \\(6\\) times gets us the probability of not being pregnant after \\(6\\) attempts. So to get the probability of being pregnant after \\(6\\) attempts, we take \\(1\\) minus this, therefore getting \\(1 - (0.8)^6\\).",

The 14” is 153.94 sq in. and the 18” slices are 31.81 sq in.\n\\[\n\\text{How many slices?} = 153.94/31.81 = 4.84 \\text{ in.}^2\n\\]\nHow much would it cost for 4.84 slices?\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 4.84 slices} = \\$4.50*4.84 = \\$21.78\n\\]\nThis means we can get the same amount of pizza for $21.78, except we can’t actually order 4.84 slices. So how about 5?\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 5 slices} = \\$4.50*5 = \\$22.00\n\\]\nThe small pizza is a terrible deal! You can get 5 slices from the 18” pizza, which is slightly more pizza area (\\(31.81*5-153.94 = 5.11\\) bonus sq in.) and is $2 cheaper!\nAnd finally, if you spent the $24 you would have on the small pizza on slices, how many could you get?\n\\[\n\\text{Slices for \\$24?} = \\$24/\\$4.5 = 5.33\n\\]\nTherefore you would have \\(5.33*31.81 - 153.94 = 15.61\\) bonus sq in., or about half a slice bonus for the same price.",
