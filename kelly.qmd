### Application: Kelly Criterion

An advanced application of expected value is the Kelly Criterion, used in betting and investment strategies. It determines the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize the long-term growth rate of capital.

The formula for the Kelly Criterion is:

$$ f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} $$

where:

- $f^*$ is the fraction of the current bankroll to bet
- $b$ is the net odds received on the bet
- $p$ is the probability of winning
- $q$ is the probability of losing (1 - p)

## Interactive Element Idea

Create an interactive simulation that demonstrates the long-term effects of using the Kelly Criterion versus other betting strategies. Allow users to adjust parameters like win probability, odds, and initial bankroll to see how these factors affect long-term outcomes.
