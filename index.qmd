## What is Expected Value (EV)?
Expected Value = (Probability of an outcome) × (Value of that outcome)

**Imagine a raffle where:**

- You buy 1 ticket for $1
- There is a 1 in 100 chance of winning
- The prize is $150

**To calculate the expected value:**

- Probability of winning: 1/100 = 0.01
- Value of winning: $150
- **Expected Value =** 0.01 × $150 = $1.50

This means that, on average, **each ticket is "worth" $1.50**.

Since the ticket costs $1, and its expected value is $1.50, it's a good deal in the long run. However, remember that this doesn't guarantee you'll win -- it's an average over many tries.

This simple calculation helps you make decisions by weighing the likelihood of outcomes against their potential value. It's a basic tool for comparing options with different risks and rewards.
