We plan to launch the first edition in 2024 and want to begin with a 2-hour trial workshop in February. It will take place virtually from 3-5pm ET (12-2pm PT) on Sunday, February 11 and/or Sunday, February 18, depending on interest. The workshop is free and your feedback will be valuable in developing the full version. No poker knowledge is expected.

In the trial workshop, we will go over: 
1. 1-Card poker rules and practice session
3. 1-Card poker strategy
4. What is a game theory optimal strategy in poker?
5. Texas Hold'em rules
6. Texas Hold'em basic strategy and practice session
7. Poker math concepts
8. Common biases that come up in poker

10. Final questions
