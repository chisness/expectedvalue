We plan to launch the first edition in 2024 and want to begin with a 2-hour trial workshop in February. It will take place virtually from 3-5pm ET (12-2pm PT) on Sunday, February 11 and/or Sunday, February 18, depending on interest. Each date can take a maximum of 8 participants.

The workshop is free and your feedback will be valuable in developing the full version. No poker knowledge is expected.

In the trial workshop, we will go over: 
1. 1-Card poker rules
2. 1-Card poker practice session
3. 1-Card poker strategy
4. What is a game theory optimal strategy in poker?
5. Texas Hold'em rules
6. Texas Hold'em basic strategy
7. Texas Hold'em practice session #1
8. Poker math concepts
9. Common biases relevant to poker
10. Texas Hold'em practice session #2

There will be an opportunity to join an advanced workshop on poker AI and algorithms in March for those who are interested and have completed this workshop.
