**Poker Camp** is a program to learn about probability, game theory, and overcoming biases, while learning poker strategy in parallel.

We plan to launch the first edition in 2024 and want to begin with a 2-hour trial workshop in February. It will take place virtually from 3-5pm ET (12-2pm PT) on Sunday, February 11 and/or Sunday, February 18, depending on interest. The workshop is free and your feedback will be valuable in developing the full version. No poker knowledge is expected.

In the trial workshop, we will go over: 
1. Basic poker rules

Some topics that we expect to cover in the full camp: 
-Poker rules
-Poker math (ex: odds, expected value, combinatorics, Bayes' Rule)
-Beginner poker strategy (ex: hand ranges, position, bet sizing)
-Risk and decision making
-Game theory fundamentals
-Advanced poker strategy
-How AI poker works 
-Rationality 

Note that the camp and related materials/workshops are for educational purposes and will not use any real money.
