# Intro to Poker -- Why Poker?

## Taking Risks
Afraid of failure, not enough risk tolerance with EV
they’re extremely risk-averse and they’re poor at capital allocation. That is, they lack the confidence to make the calls on when and how much to invest when they don’t have all the information in front of them. 
Good value doesn’t hang around long! 
His understanding of math and AI -- relating to which play to run in football, for example -- reminded me that vast majority of (successful) people don't grok math, probability, game theory, risk or any of that. "Everything is an if / then statement" as tech people say. Even some gamblers and traders think this way and manage to get it to work, but most have an intuitive understanding of distributions. But most people don't. This will never change, and we need to find ways to explain things in tech and markets in ways that make sense to those without this understanding. Especially with AI. The solution won't be to make everyone a trader, financial literacy, or making them take a Khan Academy course on probability. We need a better vocabulary for these concepts -- for those whose brains aren't wired to grok stochasticity

## Math and Probability

Smart thinking
Probabilistic thinking

## Rationality
Poker actually fairly simple, so why so difficult? So many biases and irrationalities → more rational is better
Tilt when someone gets frustrated and plays worse (can be due to anger, bad luck (esp by bad play), etc.), best to stop playing if on tilt. Probably originated from tilting a pinball machine. Emotion takes over and become kind of irrational and impulsive, ability to control and think properly not good. Some don’t even want to play with bad players! Might be actuall rational if those players make them so irrational. 
Suffer cause of some other person making bad decision, instinct is revenge/anger
Less tilt = less losing
Life tilt
If someone does not tilt, sign that they are good and have emotional control
