Poker AI Retreat (PAIR) application coming soon

**Prereqs and target ages:** PAIR material requires a background in algebra and probability. It's recommended to complete the [Poker Camp](https://pokercamp.org) material before this, though if you have a strong math and poker background, much of it won't be strictly necessary. 

PAIR covers game theory and Python and then basic calculus/linear algebra and machine learning/AI. It attempts to be self-contained, but the material is broad. 

The real life and virtual courses will target ages 13-23 (high school and college), potentially splitting into ages 13-18 and 18-23. 

**IRL NYC:** Aug 5-9, 2024

**Fellowship 1:** 10 weeks between Sep-Nov 2024

**Intensive:** 4 weeks Jan 2025
