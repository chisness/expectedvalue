Issues
Risk tolerance: Expected value doesn't account for individual risk preferences. Two options might have the same expected value, but one could be much riskier.
Non-linear utility: The subjective value (utility) of money often doesn't scale linearly. Gaining $1000 might be more than twice as valuable to someone as gaining $500.
Frequency of events: For rare events or one-time decisions, the law of large numbers doesn't apply, making expected value less reliable.
Uncertainty in probabilities: Often, the probabilities used in calculations are estimates, which can lead to inaccurate results if they're off.
Neglect of qualitative factors: Expected value focuses on quantifiable outcomes, potentially overlooking important qualitative considerations.
Assumption of independence: Many expected value calculations assume events are independent, which isn't always true in real-life scenarios.
Short-term vs. long-term outcomes: As you mentioned, time value of money isn't typically factored in, nor are potential long-term consequences.
Ethical considerations: Purely quantitative decision-making based on expected value might lead to ethically questionable choices in some situations.
Complexity of real-world scenarios: Many situations involve multiple, interrelated variables that are difficult to capture in a simple expected value calculation.
Behavioral biases: People often don't act rationally according to expected value, due to various cognitive biases and emotional factors.
Black swan events: Rare, high-impact events that are hard to predict can significantly affect outcomes but are often not accounted for in expected value calculations.
Changing circumstances: Expected value calculations assume static conditions, but real-world situations can change rapidly.

Time Value of Money:

As you mentioned, EV calculations typically do not account for the time value of money. Future cash flows need to be discounted to present value to make a proper comparison.
Risk and Uncertainty:

EV does not account for risk preferences or aversion. Two options with the same EV might have different levels of risk, which can significantly affect decision-making.
Probability Estimation:

Accurate probability estimation is crucial for EV calculations. Inaccurate or biased estimates can lead to misleading results.
Utility:

EV assumes linear utility of money, but in reality, the utility of money can be nonlinear. For example, losing $100 might feel worse than gaining $100 feels good.
Rare Events:

EV can be heavily influenced by rare, high-impact events. While these events may have a significant effect on the EV, their actual occurrence might be so infrequent that they should be considered differently.
Decision Context:

EV calculations do not always consider the broader context or other qualitative factors that may influence a decision.
Opportunity Cost:

EV does not inherently account for opportunity costs, which are the benefits you miss out on when choosing one alternative over another.
Behavioral Factors:

Human behavior often deviates from rational decision-making models. Factors such as emotions, cognitive biases, and social influences can impact decisions beyond what EV can capture.
Data Quality:

The quality and reliability of the data used to calculate probabilities and outcomes are critical. Poor data can lead to inaccurate EV calculations.
Interdependencies:

EV calculations typically assume independent outcomes, but in reality, events can be interdependent, affecting the overall decision-making process.
Long-Term vs. Short-Term:

EV may not distinguish between long-term and short-term benefits and costs, which can be important depending on the decision context.
Scalability:

EV is additive and may not scale well with large numbers of small probabilities, potentially leading to overestimation of the value of combining many low-probability events.

ev only part of picture, because if bet is big part of bankroll then not good!
