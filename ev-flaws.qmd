Issues
Risk tolerance: Expected value doesn't account for individual risk preferences. Two options might have the same expected value, but one could be much riskier.
Non-linear utility: The subjective value (utility) of money often doesn't scale linearly. Gaining $1000 might be more than twice as valuable to someone as gaining $500.
Frequency of events: For rare events or one-time decisions, the law of large numbers doesn't apply, making expected value less reliable.
Uncertainty in probabilities: Often, the probabilities used in calculations are estimates, which can lead to inaccurate results if they're off.
Neglect of qualitative factors: Expected value focuses on quantifiable outcomes, potentially overlooking important qualitative considerations.
Assumption of independence: Many expected value calculations assume events are independent, which isn't always true in real-life scenarios.
Short-term vs. long-term outcomes: As you mentioned, time value of money isn't typically factored in, nor are potential long-term consequences.
Ethical considerations: Purely quantitative decision-making based on expected value might lead to ethically questionable choices in some situations.
Complexity of real-world scenarios: Many situations involve multiple, interrelated variables that are difficult to capture in a simple expected value calculation.
Behavioral biases: People often don't act rationally according to expected value, due to various cognitive biases and emotional factors.
Black swan events: Rare, high-impact events that are hard to predict can significantly affect outcomes but are often not accounted for in expected value calculations.
Changing circumstances: Expected value calculations assume static conditions, but real-world situations can change rapidly.

Time Value of Money:

As you mentioned, EV calculations typically do not account for the time value of money. Future cash flows need to be discounted to present value to make a proper comparison.
Risk and Uncertainty:

EV does not account for risk preferences or aversion. Two options with the same EV might have different levels of risk, which can significantly affect decision-making.
Probability Estimation:

Accurate probability estimation is crucial for EV calculations. Inaccurate or biased estimates can lead to misleading results.
Utility:

EV assumes linear utility of money, but in reality, the utility of money can be nonlinear. For example, losing $100 might feel worse than gaining $100 feels good.
Rare Events:

EV can be heavily influenced by rare, high-impact events. While these events may have a significant effect on the EV, their actual occurrence might be so infrequent that they should be considered differently.
Decision Context:

EV calculations do not always consider the broader context or other qualitative factors that may influence a decision.
Opportunity Cost:

EV does not inherently account for opportunity costs, which are the benefits you miss out on when choosing one alternative over another.
Behavioral Factors:

Human behavior often deviates from rational decision-making models. Factors such as emotions, cognitive biases, and social influences can impact decisions beyond what EV can capture.
Data Quality:

The quality and reliability of the data used to calculate probabilities and outcomes are critical. Poor data can lead to inaccurate EV calculations.
Interdependencies:

EV calculations typically assume independent outcomes, but in reality, events can be interdependent, affecting the overall decision-making process.
Long-Term vs. Short-Term:

EV may not distinguish between long-term and short-term benefits and costs, which can be important depending on the decision context.
Scalability:

EV is additive and may not scale well with large numbers of small probabilities, potentially leading to overestimation of the value of combining many low-probability events.

ev only part of picture, because if bet is big part of bankroll then not good!

Relatedly, a lot of innovation can’t be identified in advance. You can’t centrally plan it for the same reasons you can’t centrally plan an economy. Michael Nielsen explained this well:

If you'd been an effective altruist in the 1660s trying to decide whether or not to fund Isaac Newton, the theologian and astrologer and alchemist, he had no legible project at all. It would have looked just very strange. You would have had no way of making any sense of what he was doing in terms of sort of an EV point of view, you know, he was laying the foundations for a worldview that would enable the industrial revolution and a complete transformation in what humanity was about.

That's true for a lot of the things that have been the most impactful things only made sense. After they were done, sometimes a long time after they were done, we didn't understand the printing press until after it was done. We certainly didn't understand writing or the alphabet, what those things meant until a long time after I don't think I'm making much sense based on the expression on your on your face, I'm trying to say, I think of expected value calculations as things that you do when you understand your state space really well and when, but most of the things which have mattered the most.
