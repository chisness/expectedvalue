## Startup vs. Normal Job
Although the concept of expected value is useful when thinking about decision making under uncertainty, we have to make a lot of assumptions. Suppose that you could take a normal job with a salary of $200,000 per year. Alternatively, you could build a startup that has the following outcomes: 

| Equity Upon Sale in 5 Years    | Probability |
| -------- | ------- |
| $\$0$  | $0.70$    | 
| $\$1m$ | $0.20$    | 
| $\$10m$   | $0.08$   |  
| $\$100m$  | $0.02$    | 

Building the startup has the following EV in millions: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[\text{Startup}] &= 0*0.70 + 1*0.20 + 10*0.08 + 100*0.02 \\
  &= 0 + 0.2 + 0.8 + 2 \\
  &= 3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Working the job with the salary has this EV in millions: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[\text{Salary}] &= 1*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 1*0.2 + 1*0.2 \\
  &= 0 + 0.2 + 0.8 + 2 \\
  &= 3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
